<p>We were not able to implement rotation animation as well as we would have liked</p>

<p>We needed to keep track of where each peice was and how we can ensure the cube was solved. We did this with 2 3X3X3 matrixs the first is a control and where every peice will start and finish, the second is where the peices are at any given point once the player rotates a side or scrambles Each cell of the matirx corespondes to a subcube ID specified in World.cpp. This solution was quite simple but elegant in how we maintain perfect information of the game state at any point.</p>
